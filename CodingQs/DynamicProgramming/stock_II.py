# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
# On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. 
# However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
# Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
